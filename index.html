  <h2 class='p1'>About</h2>
  <p>This website is built for the Davidson College DIG-245 course to explain
    how to use Dev Tools and what cool things Dev Tools gives you the ability to
    access and do. Explore as you please to learn about Dev Tools! To begin, read
    a simple way to describe Dev Tools below.</p>

  <h3 class='p1'>A Simple Way to Describe Dev Tools</h3>

  <p>I would use a metaphor to describe Dev Tools in a simple way.
    The metaphor I would choose for using Dev Tools is checking an <em>x-ray</em>. All
    the information on the outside is what you see without looking below the skin-the
    skin is the interface a user interacts with on the day-to-day. It's the way
    it all appears to the eyes. The Dev Tools are the x-ray that allow us to see
    the bones that make up the body (webpage) and see what is holding it up, holding up
    its appearance, and making it operate as it does.
