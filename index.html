  <h2 class='p1'>About</h2>
  <p>This website is built for the Davidson College DIG-245 course to explain
    how to use Dev Tools and what cool things Dev Tools gives you the ability to
    access and do. Explore as you please to learn about Dev Tools! To begin, read
    a simple way to describe Dev Tools below.</p>

  <h3 class='p1'>A Simple Way to Describe Dev Tools</h3>

  <p>I would use a metaphor to describe Dev Tools in a simple way.
    The metaphor I would choose for using Dev Tools is checking an <em>x-ray</em>. All
    the information on the outside is what you see without looking below the skin- the
    skin is the interface a user interacts with on the day-to-day. It's the way
    it all appears to the eyes. The Dev Tools are basically an x-ray that allow us to see
    the bones that make up the body (webpage). It gives developers the ability to see
    what is holding the site up, holding up
    its appearance and design, and what is making it operate as it does.

<ol class='vscl'>
  <li>Open the browswer of your choice. I will be using Safari.</li>
  <li>Pull up a site that you would like to inspect.
    I'm using the <a href="https://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a>.</li>
  <li>On the webpage of your choice, right-click and
    choose 'Inspect Element'. On Mac, for Safari, you can
    also use the keyboard shortcut <em>Option+Command+U</em>. See Figure 1.</li>
  <li>In doing so, you will have the Source Code come up on your screen. See Figure 2.</li>

  <h1>What can you do with Dev Tools?</h1>
</div>


  <ul class='udt'>
    <li>There are four icons in the top left of the Source Code screen.
      By selecting the icon that looks like a target, you are able to
      hover and click any element on the page to find the particular
      code that makes the element work.</li>
    <li>Through this Inspect element, you are also able to view the HTML code
      that makes up the website to replicate it. You can choose to copy
      the code in the Dev Tools or you can edit it directly on the
      site to see how changes would impact the webpage's body.</li>
    <li>You can inspect all the CSS Styles given to the current page, and therefore learn
      what you do and do not like, and what you might want to implement on
      your own site. If you go to inspect a particular element, you then
      are able to see all the styles applied to the particular anchor tag. This
      also grants the user the ability to change the style and see the effects
      without impacting their own code or site.</li>
    <li>The Source Code also grants the user the ability to see code, including the
      overwritten code.</li>
    <li>Debugging is benefical in Source Code because of the ability to
      check or uncheck the code, applying or unapplying a style code, respectively.</li>
    <li>In Dev Tools, you are also able to view the Sources tab, which
      allows users to view a tree of folders that make up the project. Since
      they are accessible in this tab, the user can access them live in the editor.
      It then updates live for the user to view the effects.</li>
    <li>To make saves permenant when testing new ideas, users can use the
      filesystem tab and add a folder to the workspace. By adding it to the workspace,
      the code that the user adds to test will be saved and kept. This is benefical
      when a user is testing style codes, because refreshing the page will no longer make the
      test code reset.</li>
    <li>There is also a Console tab in Dev Tools. This is where users can view, edit, and use
      javascript.</li>
    <li>Responsive Design Preview also allows users to view what the site looks on multiple
      screen sizes. This is benefical is seeing how a webpage works, or does not
      work, in changing perameters.</li>

  <h1>Console Content Example</h1>
</div>

<p class='txtad'>It turns out that finding something cool and impressive in the console proved harder than I
  initally thought it would be. I ended up changing to Google Chrome to explore
  Google's text adventure- an Easter egg, interactive game that is built
  into the console. Below are screenshots from the adventure.
  <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=text+adventure&oq=text+ad&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512j0i512l6.2483j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8'>Check it out here (must be in Chrome browser)!</a>
  After clicking the link, and opening it in Google Chrome, the user just needs to open Dev Tools and
  navigate to the console tab. The game will be playable in that tab.
