<p class='vsc'>Viewing Source Code</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your browser. I will be using Safari.</li>
    <li>Pull up a site that you would like to inspect.
      I'm using the <a href="https://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a>.</li>
    <li>On the webpage of your choice, right-click and
      choose 'Inspect Element'. On Mac, for Safari, you can
      also use the keyboard shortcut <em>Option+Command+U</em>.
      <img src='assets/img/wsj-inspect.png' height='150' width='450' />
    </li>
    <li>In doing so, you will have the Source Code come up on your screen.</li>

  <h1>What can you do with Dev Tools?</h1>
</div>

  <ul>
    <li>There are four icons in the top left of the Source Code screen.
      By selecting the icon that looks like a target, you are able to
      hover and click any element on the page to find the particular
      code that makes the element work.</li>
    <li>Through this Inspect element, you are also able to view the code
      that makes up the website to replicate it. You can choose to copy
      the code in the Source Code or you can edit it directly on the
      site to see how changes would impact the code and website.</li>
    <li>You can inspect all the CSS Styles given to it, and therefore learn
      what you do and do not like, and what you might want to implement in
      your own website. If you go to inspect a particular element, you then
      are able to see all the styles applied to the particular anchor tag. This
      also grants the user the ability to change the style and see the effects
      without impacting their own code.</li>
    <li>The Source Code also grants the user the ability to see code and
      overwritten code.</li>
    <li>Debugging is benefical in Source Code because of the ability to
      check or uncheck the code, applying or unapplying a style code, respectively.</li>
    <li>In the Source Code, you are also able to view the Sources tab, which
      allows users to view a tree of folders that make up the project. Since
      they are accessible in this tab, the user can access them live in the editor.
      It then updates live for the user to view the effects.</li>
    <li>To make saves permenant when testing new ideas, users can use the
      filesystem tab and add a folder to the workspace. By adding it to the workspace,
      the code that the user adds to test will be saved and kept. This is benefical
      when a user is testing style codes, because refreshing the page no longer makes the
      test code disappear.</li>
    <li>There is also a Console tab in Dev Tools. This is where users can use
      javascript.</li>
    <li>Responsive Design Preview also allows users to view what the site looks on multiple
      screen sizes. This is benefical is seeing how a webpage works, or does not
      work in changing perameters.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The metaphor I would choose for using Dev Tools is checking an <em>x-ray</em>. All
    the information on the outside is what you see without looking below the skin.
    The skin is the interface a user interacts with on the day-to-day. It's the way
    it all appears to the eyes. The Dev Tools are the x-ray that allow us to see
    the bones that make up the body—webpage—and see what is holding it up, holding up
    its appearance and making it operate as it does.

  <p>Finding something cool and impressive in the console proved harder than I
    initally thought it would be. I ended up changing to Google Chrome to explore
    Google's text adventure— an Easter egg, interactive game that is built
    into the console. Below are screenshots from the adventure.
